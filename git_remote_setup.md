# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

To set up the remote GitHub repository for this project, follow these steps in your terminal:

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd /home/nate/tooler/data/projects/twitch_dashboard_assistant
   ```

2. Add the GitHub repository as a remote:
   ```
   git remote add origin git@github.com:newsbubbles/twitch_dashboard_assistant.git
   ```

3. Verify the remote was added successfully:
   ```
   git remote -v
   ```

4. Push your code to the GitHub repository:
   ```
   git push -u origin master
   ```

5. Your code should now be available on GitHub at:

If you're using HTTPS instead of SSH for GitHub, use this URL format instead:
```
https://github.com/newsbubbles/twitch_dashboard_assistant.git
```
