# OBS WebSocket Integration Setup

## What We've Done

1. **Enhanced OBS Adapter Implementation**
   - Implemented a comprehensive OBS WebSocket adapter (`obs_adapter_enhanced.py`)
   - Added support for all major OBS functionality: scenes, sources, streaming control, transitions, studio mode, etc.
   - Added caching to improve performance and reduce redundant API calls
   - Improved error handling and logging
   - Added event handling for OBS state changes

2. **Documentation**
   - Created detailed setup guide (`docs/obs_websocket_setup.md`)
   - Added workflow engine notes with sample configurations (`docs/workflow_engine_notes.md`)
   - Updated progress tracking document

3. **Sample Workflows**
   - Created stream start workflow example (`workflows/stream_start_workflow.json`)
   - Created stream end workflow example (`workflows/stream_end_workflow.json`)

4. **Testing**
   - Added test script for OBS connection (`tests/test_obs_connection.py`)

5. **Environment Configuration**
   - Created template `.env.template` file with required environment variables

6. **Setup Script**
   - Created `setup_obs_integration.py` to easily set up the enhanced OBS adapter

## How to Set Up

1. **Run the setup script:**
   ```
   python setup_obs_integration.py
   ```

2. **Edit your .env file:**
   Add your OBS WebSocket password in the `.env` file

3. **Test the connection:**
   ```
   python tests/test_obs_connection.py
   ```

4. **Try it with the Dashboard Assistant:**
   Start the Dashboard Assistant agent and try commands like:
   ```
   connect_integration obs
   execute_integration_action obs get_scene_list
   set_obs_scene "Your Scene Name"
   ```
